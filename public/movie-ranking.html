<h1>The Best Movies According to Dominique</h1>
<h2>My Top RomCom Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr /> 

<h3>10 Things I hate about you</h3>
<p1>Whenever I think about classic romantic comedy movies, this will forever be the first one to pop up in my brain. This is a tense and yet so enticing "enemies to lovers" which, by the way, is my favourite genre when it comes to love story plots. Rain, hot chocolate and this movie would have to be the most fulfilling combination in my opnion. P.S. I memorized all ten things.</p1>

<h3>How to lose a guy in 10 days</h3>
<p>Even though it might seem oddly similar to the previous one, I promise there are no hidden messages I am trying to convey. This is a more satire, family friendly movie with an interesting plot twist. The two main characters, having met their match, have some internal conflict to overcome while battling for first place. It's truly such a fun watch.</p>

<h3>Clueless</h3>
<p>Obvious I can't leave out this universal favourite. From outfits and glam to falling in love with an unexpected lover. I'ts an oldie but will always be a goldie.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, you propably know my name by now. I am a university student studying Molecular Biology at Stellenbosch University in South Africa.
  I have the priviledge of taking a course on creating websites and it has truly peaked my interest during my holiday.
  I am originally from Windhoek, Namibia and live with one roommate in the most prestige street in town. I walk to Uni everyday while 
  listening to some of my favourite tunes including a lot of mac miller songs.
</p>

<p>Even though I am very new in this field, I have a very keen sense of precition and am very detail orientated, making me perfect for any websites creation. 
  It has always been an interest of mine to know and understand how a website works in the background. It is something we use on a daily basis so 
  understanding what I'm working with really makes me appreciate the time and effort that has been put in thee website to make it work. I love taking on new projects
  and creating the most beautiful project possible.
</p>
